To calculate the Standard Deviation in programming, the formula used is:

Standard Deviation
=
∑
(
𝑥
𝑖
−
𝜇
)
2
𝑁
Standard Deviation=
N
∑(x
i
​
−μ)
2

​

​

Where:

𝑥
𝑖
x
i
​
represents each value in the dataset.

𝜇
μ is the mean (average) of the dataset.

𝑁
N is the number of values in the dataset.

∑
(
𝑥
𝑖
−
𝜇
)
2
∑(x
i
​
−μ)
2
is the sum of the squared differences from the mean.

Steps to Calculate Standard Deviation:
Find the mean (average) of the dataset.

Subtract the mean from each data point, square the result, and sum all those squared differences.

Divide the sum by the number of data points (for population standard deviation) or by
𝑁
−
1
N−1 (for sample standard deviation).

Take the square root of the result from step 3.
